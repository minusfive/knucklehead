# Copied from: https://github.com/urob/zmk-config/blob/main/config/west.yml
#
# This file specifies the build dependencies for Github Action workflows and
# for local build environments. The workspace has three toplevel directories
# containing the user config, user modules and ZMK. Zephyr and its dependencies
# are namespaced under /zmk to keep the toplevel clean.
#
# ZMK-Workspace
# ├── config
# ├── modules (user modules)
# └── zmk
#     └── modules (Zephyr modules)
#
# To create a local build environment, clone this repository and then run the
# following commands from its toplevel directory:
#
# $ west init -l config
# $ west update
# $ west zephyr-export
